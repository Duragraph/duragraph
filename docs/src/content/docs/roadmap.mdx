- [ ] [Support continue-as-new runs](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/8)
- [ ] [Human-in-the-loop intervention support](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/9)

## Q3 – Data & Growth
- [ ] [Importer for external project definitions](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/10)
- [ ] [Expanded dashboard features (charts, tables, settings)](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/11)

## SDK Status

Based on our current roadmap:

### 🐍 Python SDK
- **Status**: In Development (Q1)
- **Implementation**: Python Eino adapter worker
- **Availability**: Q1 2024

### 🔷 Go SDK
- **Status**: Planned
- **Implementation**: Go adapter worker (similar to existing Go components)
- **Availability**: Q2-Q3 2024

### 🟨 TypeScript SDK
- **Status**: Planned
- **Implementation**: TypeScript/JavaScript adapter
- **Availability**: Q3 2024

### 🌐 Duragraph Cloud
- **Status**: Coming Soon
- **Features**: All self-hosted features + managed infrastructure, team collaboration, enterprise security
- **Availability**: Q2 2024

## Out of Scope
- Running untrusted user code inline in the API servers.
- Providing SLA-backed hosted services (focus is open source, self-host first).
- Proprietary model integrations (focus is on open schema, not locking into one vendor).

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Complexity of bridging runtime to different SDKs | Start with hardcoded translator + Python Eino adapter; modularize before adding others |
| Stability of early APIs | Use semantic versioning and release-please to manage changes clearly |
| Adoption dependent on docs and examples | Prioritize early docs (getting started, examples) and add versioned docs via mike |
| Webhook & integrations reliability | Implement retries, error logs, and observability early |
