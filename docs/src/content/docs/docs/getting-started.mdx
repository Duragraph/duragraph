Welcome to DuraGraph! This guide will walk you through setting up your environment and running your first workflow.

---

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

The fastest way to get DuraGraph running is with Docker Compose. No need to clone the entire repository.

### 1. Create a project directory

```bash
mkdir duragraph && cd duragraph
```

### 2. Download the Docker Compose file

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duragraph/duragraph/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 3. Download the database migrations

```bash
mkdir -p deploy/sql
curl -o deploy/sql/001_init.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duragraph/duragraph/main/deploy/sql/001_init.sql
curl -o deploy/sql/002_event_store.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duragraph/duragraph/main/deploy/sql/002_event_store.sql
curl -o deploy/sql/003_outbox.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duragraph/duragraph/main/deploy/sql/003_outbox.sql
curl -o deploy/sql/004_projections.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duragraph/duragraph/main/deploy/sql/004_projections.sql
```

### 4. Start DuraGraph

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5433) - Event store and projections
- **NATS JetStream** (port 4223) - Message streaming
- **API Server** (port 8081) - REST API endpoints
- **Dashboard** (port 5173) - Web UI

### 5. Verify services are running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

You should see: `{"status":"ok"}`

## Alternative: Full Development Setup

For contributing or customizing DuraGraph, clone the full repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duragraph/duragraph.git
cd duragraph
task up        # Start all services
task health    # Verify health
```

---

## Running Your First Workflow

1. Create an assistant:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/assistants \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "hello-assistant", "graph_schema": {}}'
   ```

2. Create a thread:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/threads \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   ```

3. Create a run:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/runs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"thread_id": "<thread_id>", "assistant_id": "<assistant_id>", "input": {"message": "Hello!"}}'
   ```
