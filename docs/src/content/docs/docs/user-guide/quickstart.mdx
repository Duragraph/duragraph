Get up and running with DuraGraph in under 5 minutes! This guide will help you run your first AI workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ (for SDK usage)
- Git

## 1. Start DuraGraph Locally

Clone and start the DuraGraph services:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duragraph/duragraph.git
cd duragraph
task up
```

This starts:
- **API Server** (port 8081) - REST API and SSE streaming
- **PostgreSQL** - Event store and projections
- **NATS JetStream** - Event streaming
- **Dashboard** (port 3000) - Workflow monitoring UI

## 2. Install the Python SDK

```bash
pip install duragraph-sdk  # Coming in Q1 2024
```

## 3. Create Your First Workflow

Create a file called `hello_workflow.py`:

```python
from duragraph import DuragraphClient, Workflow

# Initialize client
client = DuragraphClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")

# Define a simple workflow
workflow = Workflow()
workflow.add_step("greet", {
    "type": "llm_call",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Say hello to the world!"}
    ]
})

# Create and run the workflow
run = client.create_run(
    assistant_id="hello-assistant",
    thread_id="hello-thread",
    workflow=workflow
)

# Stream results
for event in client.stream_events(run.id):
    if event.type == "message":
        print(f"🤖 {event.data.content}")
```

## 4. Run the Workflow

```bash
python hello_workflow.py
```

You should see:
```
🤖 Hello, world! 👋 It's great to be here!
```

## 5. Monitor Your Workflow

Open the Duragraph Dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to:
- View workflow execution logs
- Monitor performance metrics
- Debug failed runs
- Explore workflow graphs

## Next Steps

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully run your first Duragraph workflow.

- **[Installation Guide](installation/self-hosted.md)** - Production deployment options
- **[Tutorials](tutorials/first-workflow.md)** - Step-by-step workflow building
- **[LangGraph Migration](tutorials/langgraph-migration.md)** - Migrate from LangGraph Cloud
- **[Python SDK Reference](sdks/python.md)** - Complete SDK documentation

## Troubleshooting

**Services won't start?**
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs api
```

**Python SDK not found?**
The Python SDK is currently in development (Q1 2024). For now, you can interact with the REST API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"assistant_id": "test", "thread_id": "test"}'
```
