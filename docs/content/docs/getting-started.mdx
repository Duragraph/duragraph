description: Set up DuraGraph and run your first workflow
---

Welcome to DuraGraph! This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, running your first workflow, and exploring the system architecture.

---

## 1. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Duragraph/duragraph.git
   cd duragraph
   ```

2. Start all services with Task:
   ```bash
   task up
   ```

   This starts PostgreSQL, NATS, the API server, and the dashboard.

3. Verify services are running:
   ```bash
   task health
   ```

## 2. Running a Hello World Workflow

1. Create an assistant:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/assistants \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "hello-assistant", "graph_schema": {}}'
   ```

2. Create a thread:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/threads \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   ```

3. Create a run:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/runs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"thread_id": "<thread_id>", "assistant_id": "<assistant_id>", "input": {"message": "Hello!"}}'
   ```
