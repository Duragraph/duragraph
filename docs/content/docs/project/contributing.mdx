# Contributing Guide

This document describes how to contribute to the Duragraph project. Please also review the [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Security Policy](../../SECURITY.md).

---

## Local Development

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/duragraph.git
   cd duragraph
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - **Go**: `go mod tidy`
   - **Python**: `poetry install` (see `workers/python-adapter`)
   - **Node/TypeScript** (if applicable): `npm install`

3. Run services locally:
   ```bash
   make up
   ```

---

## Make Targets

Common `make` targets are provided:

- `make build` – build Go binaries and containers
- `make test` – run all tests (Go, Python, etc.)
- `make lint` – run linting for all languages
- `make up` – start local environment via Docker Compose
- `make down` – stop local environment

---

## Commit Style

We use **Conventional Commits**:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `chore:` for maintenance
- `test:` for adding tests

Example:
```
feat(api): add SSE streaming endpoint
```

---

## Code Style

- **Go**: enforced via `gofmt`, `goimports`, and `golangci-lint` in CI.
- **Python**: linted with `ruff`, type-checked with `mypy`, formatted with `black`.
- **TypeScript**: linted with `eslint`, formatted with `prettier`.

Consistency is enforced with pre-commit hooks.

---

## Test Policy

- All new features must include corresponding unit tests.
- Conformance tests must pass before merging.
- Integration tests validate API ↔ Temporal ↔ Workers.

Run full Go tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Python adapter tests:
```bash
cd workers/python-adapter
poetry run pytest
```

---

## Conformance Tests

To run conformance tests across adapters:

```bash
make conformance
```

These verify that both Go and Python workers conform to the activity contract.
